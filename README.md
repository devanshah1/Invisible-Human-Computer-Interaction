Invisible-Human-Computer-Interaction
====================================

Capstone 2014 - 2015

The objective of this project is to develop and implement an invisible human computer interaction using the Leap Motion device as a medium of input. In continued efforts to achieve this objective, various designs were evaluated thoroughly and documented in this report. Customer requirements and technical requirements were compared to create a house of quality to derive engineering targets.  Several feasible designs were considered using different motion capture sensors that could be used for this project. After evaluating all the designs, the Leap Motion device was chosen due to its winning criteria. Standard off-the-shelf hardware and software components were chosen for the selected design concept. Engineering analysis further evaluated the chosen design using Leap Motion using the software concepts learned in previous years of the Software Engineering program. A complete design documentation using UML diagrams was created to illustrate the design on different software components and their interactions.
