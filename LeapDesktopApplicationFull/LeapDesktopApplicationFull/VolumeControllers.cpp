Function Name = LeapGestureFeedBack::volumeManipulation

Descriptive Name = Increase/decrease/mute/unmute the volume

Function =

    This functions is responsible for performing the actions of increasing/
    decreasing/muting/unmuting the volume. Makes use of the available functions on 
    windows to construct and initialize the interface of audio devices for communication.

Dependencies =

    None

Restrictions =

    Must have audio devices connected, running and capable of being accessed through the 
    IMMDeviceEnumerator interface.

Input =
    
    string controlOption - The volume action to be performed, supports the following options:
                                VOLUME_STEP_UP      - This option will increase the volume by 1
                                VOLUME_STEP_DOWN    - This option will decrease the volume by 1
                                VOLUME_MUTE_UNMUTE  - This option will mute or unmute based on 
                                                      what the state of the volume currently is.

Output =
   
   Currently there are no outputs from this functions as it only performs the action. 
   Future TODO is to make sure errors are handled and appropriate response is returned.

Normal Return =
    
    N/A

Error Return =

    N/A
