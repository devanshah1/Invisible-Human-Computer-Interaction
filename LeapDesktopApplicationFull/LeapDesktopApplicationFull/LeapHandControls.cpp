Function =

    This function is responsible for determine the finger orientation and performing
    the action that is outlined. Following is the supported action that can be performed
    based on the finger orientation:
        One finger extended    - Move the mouse based on the location of the finger in the leap
                                 orientation.
        Two fingers extended   - Perform a left click at the location where the 2 fingers are extended
                                 in the leap orientation.
        Three fingers extended - Perform a right click at the location where the 3 fingers are extended
                                 in the leap orientation.

Dependencies =

    Depends on if a hand was detected in the leap motion listener.

Restrictions =

    Can only perform 3 actions when fingers are detected on the leap motion listener.
        MOVE_MOUSE         - Performs the action of moving the mouse
        MOUSE_LEFT_CLICK   - Performs the action of doing a left click with the mouse

                             action is performed, this will simulate a dragging action
                             with the mouse. (i.e. moving folders, drawing in paint)

Function Name = LeapGestureFeedBack::moveMouse

Descriptive Name = Moves the pointer from one position to another based on the leap
                   input points and calculated 2D rendering of the point on the 
                   screen.

Function =

    This function is responsible for perform the action of moving the pointer from 
    one point to another based on the leap data. The leap data is converted from 3D
    to 2D and the tip of the finger is used to identify the point where the pointer
    should be on the screen. Also supports perform an Left and Right click using the 
    pointer. Furthermore also supports dragging from one point to another using the left 
    click.

Dependencies =

    This function depends on the windows aspect of moving the mouse pointer. Makes use of
    windows function calls to achieve the task of moving and clicking of the pointer.

Restrictions =

    Must have a mouse pointer available to use this function

                                                     when the left click is continuously click and a dragging 
                                                     action is performed, this will simulate a dragging action

                                MOUSE_RIGHT_CLICK  - Performs the action of doing a right click with the mouse

Output =

    Currently there are no outputs from this functions as it only performs the action.
    Future TODO is to make sure errors are handled and appropriate response is returned.

Normal Return =

    N/A

Error Return =

    N/A

Future Work
    
    Enhance the mouse detection and clicking algorithm to make sure that it does not 
    perform multiple clicks and move to fast.
