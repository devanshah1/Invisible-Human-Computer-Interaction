Function Name = LeapDesktopAppFull::applicationWindowManipulation

Descriptive Name = Switch between windows. Next and previous from main window.

Function =

    This function is used to switch between windows based on the function parameter.
    The windows are switched using the main window as the pivot point (next and previous)
    from this point.

Dependencies =

    N/A

Restrictions =

    Needs to have a main window active to allow to get the next and previous windows
    from the main starting point. Also need to make sure that there were actual next
    and previous windows to even switch to. Windows stack needs to have previous and
    next.

Input =

    string windowOption - Which direction to switch the window to, supports the following options:
                                APP_WINDOW_NEXT      - This option will set the active window as 
                                                       the next window in the stack from the main
                                APP_WINDOW_PREVIOUS  - This option will set the active window as 
                                                       the previous window in the stack from the main

Output =

    Currently there are no outputs from this functions as it only performs the action.
    Future TODO is to make sure errors are handled and appropriate response is returned.

Normal Return =

    N/A

Error Return =

    N/A
